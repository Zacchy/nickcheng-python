pymsn - Python msn client library
=================================

pymsn is a rewrite of libivy (http://hybrid.tuxfamily.org/ivy), during this
rewrite the usage of python asyncore and asynchat were droped in favor of
the pymsn.gio library based on glib GIOChannel. This change enabled easy
integration with the glib main loop.

well a Http Polling transport and proxy support.
