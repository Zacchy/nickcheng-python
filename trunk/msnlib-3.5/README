----------------------------------------------

This is a python implementation for the msn messenger protocol (version 8),
it's pretty simple and straightforward; but it works well.

Please read the 'INSTALL' file to see how to install and use both the client
and the library.

The client is really simple, uses a text-mode interface with commands similar
to 'micq' (http://micq.ukeer.de/), which is a great ICQ client. 

If you're looking for a good messaging system, forget about messenger and try
Jabber (http://www.jabber.org), it's the only one which is run in the open
based on public standards, it's safe, fast, has a lot of features and it's
quite scalable. 

But if you're stucked with messenger for whatever reason (your friends,
family, the dog, all use it =), I hope you find this useful.


The basic idea for the library is a main class which represents a connection
with the server and holds all the relevant information, it has only the a few
methods to login, change some info and status, and send messages; all the rest
is driven by an asyncronous callback scheme registered at runtime which can be
changed on the fly.

If you're intrested, read the code to find out more; most of the documentation
is there either as command or as python documentation strings. You might also
want to check out the doc directory; specially if you use a non-unix platform,
take a look at the 'portability' file.


Comments and patches are always welcome; please send them to the mailing list,
msnlib-devel@auriga.wearlab.de.

Thanks,
