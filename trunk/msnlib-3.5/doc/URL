The URL for the project is http://users.auriga.wearlab.de/~alb/msnlib
I want to thank Henne Vogelsang and Auriga for providing the hosting.

There is also a freshmeat project page that it's easier to remember:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/msnlib

And finally, there's the mailing list, msnlib-devel@auriga.wearlab.de, with url
http://lists.auriga.wearlab.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msnlib-devel.
